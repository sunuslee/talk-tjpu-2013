That's not that easy. if you are interested. it uses:

* Emacs(editor)
* Nodejs(runtime/framework)
* Reveal.js(framework)
* Markdown for writing
* Javascript for controlling
* HTML, CSS, etc.

Pretty much like the way you do things in Linux:)


##Do Not Freak Out!
1. Choose a well-documented distribution base on your preferences.
2. Choose a handy editor.
3. You are good to go.
4. use, read, ask, discuss, modify.
